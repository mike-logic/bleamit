# bleamit

**bleamit** is a synchronized lighting and color broadcast system designed for live events, concerts, and interactive installations.

It uses ESP32 microcontrollers with BLE advertisements and ESP-NOW communication to broadcast color data to mobile phones and LED nodes in real time.

## Roles

### ðŸŸ¦ Base
- Connects to Art-Net or proxy server
- Broadcasts RGB color data to hubs and nodes
- Hosts the local dashboard for monitoring and approval

### ðŸŸ© Hub
- Relays ESP-NOW color data from base to nodes
- Handles seat/section-specific packet filtering
- Sends heartbeat packets back to base

### ðŸŸ¨ Node
- Receives color data from base or hub
- Advertises the current RGB color over BLE to nearby smartphones
- Sends heartbeat packets for presence tracking
